// This is a collection of packages for doing various things inside of a rocket engine.
// We have some fluid bodies and combustion chambers and stuff like that.
// The important thing is that each of these should make perfect sense on their own, and not worry about how they'll be used.
// Then we have adapters to make them work in the simulators.
